## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I tried to apply the html semantic tags where ever I could have used , still learning about the HTML semantic tags.
Tried writing the media queries myself ðŸ˜Ž, uptill now I used tailwind css to handle the responsive media queries

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {

  @media (max-width:375px){
      .avatar-jessica{
        height: 60px;
        width: 60px;
      }
      .name{
        font-size: 20px;
      }
      .location{
        font-size: 12px;
      }
      .profession{
        font-size: 10px;
      }
      .attribution{
        font-size: 10px;
      }
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning the HTML semantics, writing the media query with mobile first approach as it is industry standard.
I want to explore about the accessiblity more and learn about it.
Continue reading the book , You don't know JS and honestly this book is a gold standard for learning about js.


### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - Like all of you I also used the ChatGPT ðŸ˜‚ to review my code and it gave me suggestion about how to improve the media query and html semantics
- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Amazing resource for learning anything in web.
